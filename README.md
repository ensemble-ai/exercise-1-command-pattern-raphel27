# Exercise 1 Summary

# Stage 1

For stage 1, I create a filr called MoveCharactetRight.cs to achieve the right move function. The file is quite same with MoveCHaracterLeft and I change the direction and flip function.


# Stage 2 & 3

For stage 2 & 3, I create three working mode the detail of function will beexplained in the code files.

# Stage 4

For stage 4, I add jump feature to the captaion by creating a file called CharacterJump.cs. This file quite like MoveCharactetRight.cs. When the player click "fire2", the captaion will be given a up velocity and achieve jump function. I also add restriction to this function to make the captaion only can jump once per click.
